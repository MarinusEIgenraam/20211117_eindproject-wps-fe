# Willpowered students

This application was made as a final project for a Full-stack Web-Development bootcamp NOVI Hogeschool in the
Netherlands

The application consists of 2 parts:

- wps-fe The front-end part
- wps-be The back-end part

The front end part is a React based web-app with a project management functionality. As user you can create projects and
invite others to help you with achieving your goal. You can log in to your portal to manage your open projects and
tasks. As an administrator you also have the functionality to create and host Blogs. These are hosted on the blog page
and people can on them with comments. Users can leave comments at projects as well although this depends on the public
visibility of the project.

# Styled Components

I used styled components to style the components and tried to keep these as organised as I could while trying to get
everything done in time. I failed on this part but regained strength and enthusiasm the last days before the deadline. I
will definitely keep working on the project for a while because I naively had an ot more functionalities in mind.
